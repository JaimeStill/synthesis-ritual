# Synthesis Ritual

This repository represents an ongoing creative practice of synthesizing ideas through conversational exploration with an LLM. It is intended to store the ideas, narratives, and potential experiments that emerge from this practice.

## Repository Structure

- [`concepts`](./concepts/readme.md) - serves as a collecting ground for emergent thoughts, inspirations, and theoretical explorations. Ideas here may be incomplete, experimental, or in early stages of development.
- [`artifacts`](./artifacts/readme.md) - contains more developed iterations of `concepts` that have progressed beyond the initial concept stage. They have materialized into more structured and comprehensive forms, but are not yet finalized implementations.
- [`lab`](./lab/readme.md) - hosts a collection of `experiments` for exploring code-based concepts and practical implementations. Experiments serve as a workspace for testing, prototyping and simulating ideas. It provides a controlled environment to validate concepts and develop artifacts through practical application.
- [`codex`](./codex/readme.md) - serves as the definitive repository of completed `artifacts` and / or `experiments` synthesized through this ritual process. Entries in the codex represent fully realized expressions of concepts that have been developed, tested, and refined.
