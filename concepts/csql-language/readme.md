# Hybrid SQL / C# Language

I would like your assistance creating a hybrid, functional, dynamic SQL-like language that combines with C#. Inspiration for this language is a combination of the following:

- LINQ features in C# that blend a query-like syntax with the powerful features of .NET
- JSX / TSX blending code and interface templating into the same language.

The query features should be valid T-SQL with a decorator used at the heading of the file to indicate which flavor of SQL (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySql, SqLite, etc.) to interpret.

The file extension for the language should be `.csql`.

The language should not be overly complicated. It should merely focus on extending the T-SQL language to be more expressive in terms of providing functions, object / collection state, and features that enable parameterized / dynamic query generation based on its current state.

The output of this file should be able to be fed into a raw Microsoft.Data.SqlClient connection for execution. The basic functionality of the language would be to condition the query, output the resulting query at the moment execution is requested, then hand off control flow to the .NET program leveraging it.

## Response

I'll help you design this hybrid language. Let's create a specification and some example implementations.

I've created a [specification for the CSQL language](./csql-spec-01.md) that combines the power of T-SQL with C# features while maintaining simplicity. Let me explain the key design decisions:

1. The language uses a declarative approach similar to LINQ but preserves direct SQL syntax for better readability and maintainability.

2. State management is handled through a C#-like class declaration, making it familiar to .NET developers.

3. Functions are used to encapsulate common query patterns, similar to how JSX components work.

4. The interpolation syntax (@{...}) is consistent with C# string interpolation but distinct enough to avoid conflicts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the language design? I can also create additional examples showing:

1. How to implement the parser/compiler
2. More complex query patterns
3. Integration with Entity Framework
4. Advanced type mapping scenarios

Let me know what interests you most and I'll provide more detailed examples in that direction.

## Prompt

Some additional thoughts:

- you should not have to specify the .csql file, but rather instantiate it as you would a proper C# object. Instantiation would consist of initializing the query state and the result would be the processed query.

- along with the flavor of SQL, the decorator header should also support specifying either a raw connection string, or a connection string configuration key.

## Response

Excellent suggestions! This makes the language feel more native to C# and follows better dependency injection patterns. Let me revise the specification.

I've [updated the specification](./csql-spec-02.md) to reflect a more C#-native approach where:

1. Queries are proper C# classes that can be instantiated and injected
2. Connection configuration is more flexible, supporting both direct strings and configuration keys
3. The query system integrates naturally with .NET's dependency injection
4. Type safety is enhanced through generic type parameters
5. Result mapping is more robust using records and automatic Dapper integration

The key improvements are:

1. No need to manually load .csql files - they're compiled into proper C# classes
2. Better dependency injection support
3. More flexible connection management
4. Stronger typing with C# records
5. Better integration with existing .NET patterns

Would you like me to:
1. Create an example of the compiler implementation?
2. Show more complex query patterns?
3. Demonstrate integration with specific ORMs?
4. Explore the type system in more detail?

Let me know what aspects you'd like to explore further.
