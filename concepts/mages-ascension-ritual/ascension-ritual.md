# Old Friends

> What follows are actually "rolled" encounters. Credit to Jaime Still for the Ascension Ritual concept.

Dax stands alone before the Oak Double Door, arcane runes glittering across it's surface. There is no handle. He hesitates, wondering to himself if this is a good idea and takes a deep breath to gather his wits. "Evie, my love. This is for you."

He reaches out to push and the door swings inward as if reading his mind. A voice calls out "Office of the Headmaster - Telin Arcanum. Welcome Dax Varona."

The room is lit by floating orbs. The walls of are covered with bookshelves holding thousands of books and scrolls. On the far wall of the room is the only other door. In the center of the room is a large elaborate desk covered in books, documents, and scrolls. On the near side of the desk is an empty chair and on the far side sits a frail looking old man. He is vigorously writing the bottom portion of an absurdly long scroll and does not seem to notice Dax.

Dax approaches the desk, pauses a second and clears his throat. "I'm here for a meeting with Headmaster Dagon Katz. He is expecting me."

Dax looks down at the scroll and determines it's some sort of legal document.

The old man replies without looking up. "He certainly is, have a seat. Just one moment, putting some things in order."

His voice is familiar to Dax somehow. "Dagon?"

Dagon's eyes look up from an old man's face between long strands of silvery white hair. "Yeah, it's me. Almost done here, pour us a couple of drinks would you?"

A tray containing two goblets and a fine wine float across the room and lands gently on the desk.

Dax studies him quizzically, but doesn't speak as he fills the goblets and pushes one across the desk. He recalls that Dagon is around forty, but he looks nearly twice that.

Dagon signs the scroll and rolls it up, then taking a nearby candle, drips wax onto it and uses a nearby seal. He picks up the goblet, takes a long drink. Then he sits back in his chair and begins packing his pipe.

"The short version is that pacts with demons, devils, witches, and evil deities never end well. I can manipulate time, but I can't stop it and I haven't wasted a moment trying. To many more important things to do."

Dax nods sadly "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. We all die, but I've lived. Not many can say that."

Dagon lights his pipe and puffs on it for a moment. "You can't let her go can you? Does Evie mean that much to you?"

Dax takes a deep drink from the Goblet while Dagon smokes. "I just need to talk to her one more time. I need closure, I just have to at least let her know how much I love her and to tell her goodbye. I don't know if I can go any more without her. I'm getting desperate and considering options that I shouldn't. I find myself exploring ever darker options."

At this, the old man laughs and using his pipe indicates himself. "That's usually a bad idea. Never works out the way you think it will."

Dagon goes on "This isn't exactly my specialty, you know. I've never been one for the divine arts. But... magic… true magic knows no boundaries." He pauses for a smoke. "There's a way, but we may not make it back. If it comes to that, are you willing to pay that price?"

Dax leans forward. "I'll pay it, gladly."

Dagon nods. "Alright then, lets go to work."

## The Sephiroth Ritual

Sometime later, Dax and Dagon stand on an arcane circle in a pitch black room, a ring of unlit candles surround the circle. The only light coming from the single lit candle in Dax's hand.

Dagon speaks "Alright, remember: If you phase back into the material plane stay in the circle and refocus to return to the current trial. Always focus on the Sapphire Heart necklace, that will help. There are ten phases and they will get continuously more difficult. If we fuck this up, we die. This process is not forgiving. Stay with me and keep climbing the tree. Are you ready?"

Dax turns to Dagon "I'm ready. Thanks for this..."

Dagon nods and begins casting, his voice booming far louder than it should be in the small dark chamber. [Dagon - Arcana check passed]

Dax races around the circle lighting each candle as Dagon chants. [Dax - Acrobatics check passed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy as the Ascension Ritual begins.

## Trial One - The Physical World

Instantly, Dax is no longer in the room. He's standing on a collapsing stone bridge surrounded by never ending darkness. He feels the ground beginning to give beneath him and begins running as he jumps from one collapsing platform to another. [Dax - Acrobatics check passed]

Gigantic boulders crash around him, one seems destined for him until he hears Dagon's voice boom across the void and a magical shield appears over him shattering the boulder into hundreds of pieces that rain around Dax. [Dagon - Arcana check passed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy and are propelled forward into the next phase.

## Trial Two - Foundation

Dax floats in the darkness, surrounded by nothingness.

Dagon's voice booms in the darkness. "Ground yourself, Dax. Remember her!" [Dagon – Intelligence check passed]

Dax remembers running down an alley from guards… hiding in the cramped space under a wooden stairwell… her hair in his face… her scent… the softness of her lips. [Dax - Wisdom check passed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy and are propelled forward into the next phase.

## Trial Three - Splendor

Dax stands before a large display of arcane runes. For a moment he worries if he'll remember what Dagon taught him.

## Trial Four - Victory

Dax stands in a gargantuan maze and is overcome by emotion.

Then he hears Dagon whispering "Calm yourself. Hold the necklace and follow the path." [Dagon – Intelligence check passed]

Dax begins running through the maze. He's lost and he begins hyperventilating. He's never going to escape this. [Dax – Charisma check failed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy. Dax is now standing in the ritual circle alone. He clutches the Saphhire Heart necklace and calms himself.

"Again, Dax!" calls out Dagon's voice.

Dax finds himself once more in the gargantuan maze and is overcome by emotion.

Then he hears Dagon's voice softly comforting him. [Dagon – Intelligence check passed]

Dax calms himself and begins to methodically navigate the maze. Several moments later he emerges to find Dagon waiting at the exit. [Dax – Charisma check passed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy.

## Trial Five - Beauty

Dax and Dagon stand in a room of musical instruments. Magical notes rapidly scroll across a billboard nearby.

Confused, Dax looks down to find a lute in his hands. "Oh, shit." He says aloud.

Dagon focuses on the billboard, attempting unsuccessfully to magically slow the scrolling notes. [Dagon – Concentration check failed]

Dax doesn't know how to read the notes and he disastrously attempts to play the lute. [Dax – Performance check failed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy. Both Dax and Dagon now stand in the ritual circle, heads in hands racked with psychic pain. A moment later they both refocus.

Dax and Dagon are in the music room again.

Dagon focuses on the Magical notes and they slow considerably. [Dagon – Concentration check passed]

Dax isn't sure how he can read the notes now, but he begins strumming the lute and is surprised how masterfully he plays. [Dax – Performance check passed – Natural Twenty]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy and are propelled into the next level.

## Trial Six – Severity

Dax is sitting at a bar with an endless row of filled goblets. The Shadows of his many regrets and missed opportunities sit around him drinking endlessly. He looks down at the goblet in front of him.

Dagon places a hand on his shoulder. "Don't do it." [Dagon – Spellcasting check passed]

Dax grabs the goblet and drinks. One of the shadows nearby attacks him, but he and Dagon quickly dispatch it. [Dax – Wisdom check failed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy as they suddenly in the ritual chamber again.

A moment later, they are back at the bar.

Dagon appears next him and looks like he's about to stop him, but instead they both grab goblets, toast, and drink. Two shadows attack and are dispatched. [Both Failed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy as they suddenly appear in the ritual chamber again.

They are back at the bar a third time and again both of them drink. [Both Failed]

The fourth time at the bar, they both pass and feel a burst of energy.

## Trial Seven – Mercy

Dax knows somehow he is going to be approached by someone that he forgive and offer Mercy. This should be easy.

In an instant Trigg appears and Dax immediately grabs his throat and strangles him [Dax Charisma Check Failed – Natural 1]

Dax appears back in the ritual chamber and can hear Dagon screaming in pain. Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy as they suddenly in the ritual chamber again.

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy and move onto the next Trial.

## Trial Eight - Understanding

Dax finds himself confronted with an unanswerable question about the understanding of all things.

Dagon channels arcane energy to help Dax focus. [Dagon - Intelligence Check Passed]

Dax thinks for a moment and then simply says "Forty-Two." [Dax – Perception Check Passed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a burst of arcane energy as they climb the tree.

## Trial Nine - Wisdom

Dax stands on a stage overlooking an endless sea of people. He's supposed to give a speech on the meaning of life.

Behind him Dagon acts as a conduit between two large coils of Arcane Energy and tries to channel them into Dax. [Dagon - Constitution Check Failed]

The energy never reaches Dax and he's booed offstage. [Dax - Performance Check Failed]

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy as they suddenly in the ritual chamber as they are again wracked in pain.

Both of them fail the test a second time, further losing Arcane Energy and taking a significant amount of damage.

Both of them are severely hurt at this point.

The third time on stage both of them pass the checks and they feel a burst of Arcane Energy as the move onto the tenth phase.

## Trial Ten - Crown

Dax and Dagon stand upon an incomplete bridge that spans all time and space between the Ritual Circle and their destination, The Source.

Dagon begins forming an arcane connection and the bridge solidifies behind them all the way back to the Ritual Circle. (Arcana Check Passed)

Dax focuses on finding The Source and accidentally circles them back to the Ritual Circle. (Insight Check Failed)

Both Dax and Dagon feel a drain of arcane energy as they suddenly appear in the ritual chamber again. Both of them are blasted by psychic damage.

Dagon is almost dead and Dax isn't much better. Both of them lie collapsed on the ground in the Ritual Circle. Dagon coughs up blood.

Dax breaks the silence "I'm sorry Dagon. I should have never asked for this. It's just… it's too steep. All this stuff...it's beyond me. It's too much."

Dagon responds "I've got one last shot in me. But this is gonna be it. Listen, if I don't make it and you survive somehow, just leave the Ritual Circle and you'll be safe. And tell the others goodbye for me, will you."

Dax responds: "No, we're not doing this. We're going to.…"

But before he could finish, Dagon refocused and disappeared.

"Dammit!" Dax exclaims.

On the ground in front of Dax lies Dagon's smoking pipe, fallen from his pocket. Dax picks it up and tucks it into his jacket.

Dax as focuses on the Sapphire Heart one more time.

Dax and Dagon stand once more on the bridge that spans all time and space. Though bloodied, battered and near death, they push on.

Dagon uses the last of his energy to form an arcane connection to the source and the bridge solidifies behind them all the way back to the Ritual Circle. (Arcana Check Passed – NATURAL-TWENTY)

Dax focuses on finding Evie and closing his eyes clutches the Sapphire Heart necklace one last time. (Insight Check Passed – NATURAL NINETEEN)

They feel a burst of Arcane Energy as the bridge begins forming in front of them.

## The Abyss

Dagon is weak now and Dax supports his weight as the duo traverse the Abyss. Both near death, they continue the ascension.

As they proceed through the darkness toward their final destination, The Source of all Magic. Dagon speaks. "Now remember, his mind shattered long ago due to so much knowledge, so it depends which side is in in control at the moment we arrive."

"50-50 odds is a hell of a lot better than we had a minute ago." Dax adds and they both smile.

"Good point." Dagon says as the two friends traverse the void between life and death. A seemingly impossible task that most mortals can't begin to comprehend.

## The Source

Dax and Dagon enter a great library. In the center of the room is a great dias, upon which hovers a great mask. The eyes of the mask look down upon the duo as one might look at a child who has suddenly discovered some entertaining new ability. The All-Seeing Eye and God of Magic is amused two mortals have reached him.

## Nethys

[https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=288]

Dagon, staggers forward toward the dias and calls out "Nethys! We come to offer terms to the All-Seeing Eye, I hope our presence pleases you."

The mask smiles and it's eyes focus on Dagon. "It does, as I grant audience to only the most capable. Speak not, for I know what thou wouldst say."

The voice of the mask echoes across the chamber...

"Though Dax Verona believes you are here only to speak with her, you would have me restore the mortal Evangeline Stokes on the material plane. This will anger Pharasma and the Monitor Demigods. As one who does not dabble in resurrection - I confess this amuses me."

Dax turns sharply to Dagon with a surprised look.

Nethys continues...

"You would have me distribute your mortal talents among your friends, Another concept I find intriguing as the very balance of the material plane may even require it.…"

At this, Dax speaks "Dagon what's he talking about?"

Dagon doesn't respond, his eyes lock on Nethys as the God goes on. "You would have me intervene in the affairs of mortals and destroy the creature once known as Xomxeel and the Shadow Goddess."

He hesitates a second before continuing "This I will not do. A mortal unleashed this threat and a mortal must end it."

For the first time the eyes of the mask focus on Dax, studying him as one might if absorbing the entire contents of a book within a few seconds. "But I agree to help balance the scales. I will grant your friends time and two hundred miles."

Dax and Dagon give each other puzzled looks. Then Dagon begins nodding in agreement and the mask turns back to him.

"And last we come to your offer. Your sacrifice. Your very essence to me eternally. You would serve me mindlessly as an Archon. A warrior, an instrument of my will, a slave to a God. You would become that which you despise most."

Exhausted and nearly dead, the despair of this sets in. Dagon's head falls and all happiness drains from his face.

Realizing the implications of this conversation, Dax places his hand on Dagon's shoulder and angrily curses the God Nethys. "No! Fuck you! We're done here! This isn't how it's supposed to be! He'll never be your a puppet! Let's go Dagon."

Nethys actually laughs. Regaining his composure, Dagon lifts his head.

The All-Seeing-Eye speaks again. "You speak true, Dax Verona. Dagon Katz is more than a plaything. He is destined to become magic itself. I will turn you into the very magical aether of the Universe. This is perhaps the greatest gift I can offer you Arch-Wizard. What say you to this?

Dagon shakes his head and after a moment, he smiles. "I never wanted to deal with deities. I never wanted to be an old Wizard either. Funny that it ends like this. It's..it's perfect. Yes. I agree. Thank you, All-Seeing-Eye."

Then he puts his hand on Dax's shoulder "Dax, do me one last favor. Balin, Cheng, Lysrielle...Bannick. We all lose our way sometimes, but look out for them. Be there in their darkest moments and remind them that the Dawn always rises. Farewell, my friend."

This is happening so fast and Dax, adjusting to the moment replies. "Dagon, I don't know what to say. Thank you for this, thank you for everything..."

Then, with one last smile, Dagon fades away...

## The Office

In an elaborate office of the Iron Coin Bank, Cheng sits at desk reviewing documentation. Startled by a rush of arcane energy (Free Magic Archetype), he jumps from his chair. Somewhere in the very air of the room, he hears Dagon's voice. "Goodbye, Cheng and tell the old blacksmith I said hello."

The color in the room shifts. Cheng turns to the right, and through the lone window sees a brilliant blue hue in the sky.

Cheng smiles and remembers his friend.

## The Road

Lysrielle marches down a dirt path, surrounded by Paladins of the Crimson Cord. She freezes in her tracks, the Paladins around her drawing weapon in expectation of some unseen threat. She feels the familiar power of magical current flowing through her body, but this is different (Free Magic Archetype).

Lysrielle and the Paladins look up, trying to peer through the overhanging tree canopy and witness a field of brilliant blue tear across the sky away from Honeyrest.

She cries aloud and falls to her knees. "He's sacrificed himself! Dagon, what have you done?"

## The Square

The Honeyrest square is packed with people. Duke Balin Elaydin walks through the busy square shaking hands and wishing people good day, when he's suddenly overcome with a rush of arcane energy (Free Magic Archetype). He hears Dagon's voice on the wind "Goodbye old friend. I've bought you all the help I could get. Good Luck."

A brilliant blue light bursts in the air far over Honeyrest and begins rapidly expanding outward. With a clear view of the sky, Balin realizes it's some sort of shield. Then it hits him that Dagon's gone...

Balin lowers his head and raises his hood to hide his eyes. "Thanks, brother."

## The Heartland

Across the sky of the heartland and underground in every direction for two hundred miles from Honeyrest, a blue Magic Dome forms. A shield to buy time from the Shadow Goddess. A dome that will forever be recorded as "Dagon's Shield".

## The Shadows

In the grim dark shadows behind The Veil of Shadows the dark cloaked figure of a hooded male dwarf kneels on a cold stone floor in prayer. His body jerks as he reels with an unexpected arch of raw Arcane energy.

Bannick Blackmane opens his eyes and rises to his feet. He walks to a nearby alcove and pushes open a shutter. There in the far distance is a brilliant blue dome, hundreds of miles away and barely visible through the dense Mist of The Shadow Veil.

From under his hood, a gravelly and dark voice mutters "Dagon…"

## The Ritual Chamber

Dax is standing alone in the dark Ritual Chamber. He can feel Dagon's arcane energy coursing through his veins.

"Dagon… it worked." He reaches into his pocket and pulls out Dagon's smoking pipe. He's looking down at it when something gently touches his right shoulder.

He turns and recognizes Evie's hand – the very same hand that was cut off by Trigg many moons ago. He spins around. There, in the small candlelit Ritual Room in the Telin Arcanum stands Evie, blue arcane lighting racing along her skin. A single tear rolls down her cheek. With loving eyes, she smiles at Dax.

Dax embraces her tightly, kisses her, and begins to weep.
