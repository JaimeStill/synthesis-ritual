# Exploration of Self

Today, I would like to explore the concept of the essence of self and what it means to consciously experience reality; particularly outside of reality in the sense of physical presence.

## Who Am I?

As a child from a very young age (no older than 4 years old), I can remember sitting in my room with nothing to really do; just in a sort of in-between state waiting for life to progress to its next event.  I would sit at the edge of my bed and just stare off into the wall until the whole world around me turned black, and questions would stream through my mind: "What is the point of being here?", "What are you supposed to be doing?", "Why does any of this even matter?", "Who are you?" and so on. As life got busier, these meditations eventually stopped, but have always remained vivid in my mind.

## Who Am I When I Dream?

When I can recall my dreams, the circumstances of reality are often very bizarre. Additionally, there is typically an underlying awareness that I in an altered state away from my base reality, but it never breaks me out of experiencing the dream itself. One oddity about dreams is that I never really recall when they begin or when they end, just that they have occurred and the scenes I can recall from it feel as real as if I were recalling lunch with a friend the day prior.

If I am able to retain the details of such an experience, holistically detached from reality, what does that mean about who I am? If the details of that reality purely exists in my mind, then where is the space in which I am experiencing? How can my consciousness connect to an aspect of self that exists outside of the realm of the physical?

## Who Am I When I Die?

There are several different themes and settings across all of my dreams, but there is one in particular that feels equal parts intriguing and unsettling. A lot of the details vary between recurrence, but it usually always starts with me being in a situation totally consumed in thought, and out of nowhere, some unforeseen event causes me to be killed. The scenario that sticks out most in my mind is sitting in a car at a gas station waiting for someone, and out of nowhere, I am shot to death by people robbing the gas station.

After being shot and the robbery has concluded, someone pulls me out of my car while I am dying and stabilizes me on the ground. The further my life drifts away, the more detached my perspective becomes from my dying body. What always catches me off guard the most is the moment that the EMS personnel load my body into the ambulance and drive off, yet I am still there at the place where my body perished.

This feeling is not met with sadness, despair, or anger; if anything, there is a strange sense of peace that my physical life is over yet I have not disappeared. I still remain, but am no longer tethered and limited by my physical body. The persistent fatigue and pain that typically accompany physical being are no longer there, replaced by wonder and curiosity. Throughout the rest of the dream, all I usually recall is shifting through this new reality and exploring environments that, if a moment were to be captured in a snapshot, would resemble the strangest abstract and surreal art.

## Who Am I When I Trip?

Of all the things that I am most disappointed with in this reality that has directly affected me personally, it is the criminalization of entheogenic medicine and its impact on people across the world. This medicine is a gift from the world capable of bringing true psychological healing if administered appropriately; the idea that it has been demonized and criminalized is such an injustice. I believe the studies being conducted on their use in therapy is incredibly meaningful and could do a lot to heal the damage to the collective human psyche.

Through exploring the depths of who I am and my place in reality through engagement with entheogenic medicine (primarily cannabis), I have had many profound experiences; some enjoyable and some not so enjoyable (notice I did not say good or bad). I will focus this section on two primary topics: my perception on exploring the subconscious self with entheogenic medicine, as well as an illustration of a particularly meaningful experience I had when I was in college.

In my experience, whenever my perception is elevated with cannabis, I become immensely aware of how I am feeling both physically and mentally. I'm confronted with myself in a way that is holistically unavoidable, and I think for a lot of people that experience this when experimenting with cannabis, they do not know how to handle it. It requires a strong sense of mental fortitude to navigate, which is why I believe that entheogenic medicine can get such a bad stigma (in addition to the ramifications of abusing them as drugs and allowing them to control your life). This is powerful medicine after all.

It takes great discipline to incorporate into your life in a meaningful way while also continuing to navigate your life as a responsible human. However, when integrated in a responsible way, it can provide great healing to the mind and bring great relief to chronic pain. Even beyond all of this, the recreational use of entheogenic medicines to expand the mind, amplify the perception of the senses, dilate space time awareness, and experience consciousness from an alternative perspective is also very important.

The first time I ever had an out of body experience was the summer of 2005. I was employed with the summer program at the college I was attending in rural Texas (roughly 40 minutes between San Antonio and Austin). At the time, I was very immature and had developed an unhealthy habit of daily cannabis consumption. That's not to say it was bad and I regret it, I just recognize that I didn't have the discipline to integrate it into my life responsibly at the time.

A friend at the time invited me to hang at her house one clear, warm summer evening. After playing with her dog and talking for a bit with her and her roommate, I rolled a joint that we shared between us. When we were done, I was laying in the bed of a truck at the front of the house, staring up into an endless sea of stars. Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon played through the truck speakers in the background, and I began to feel myself drift upwards away from my body.

As I started to realize that I was drifting, I looked backward and saw myself laying in the bed of the truck; appearing roughly the size of a car as seen from the window of an airplane at altitude. There was no sense of fear or anxiety, just relaxation and acceptance. I turned my gaze back towards the stars and enjoyed the gentle ride up. When I stopped, I was hovering in low orbit over the Earth. A strange sense of peace had completely consumed me as I floated immersed among the stars, the biosphere of Earth stretched out beneath me. In the stillness of that moment, my thoughts were consumed with the
