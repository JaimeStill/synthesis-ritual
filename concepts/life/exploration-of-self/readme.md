I've taken some time to [reflect](./reflection.md) on some experiences in my life that have stuck with me through the years, exploring the idea of "who am I?" and "where does who I am originate?". Please analyze this writing in the context of current scientific and psychological understanding of the self. Reflect as if you are a trained psychiatrist being given a window into the mind of a patient.
