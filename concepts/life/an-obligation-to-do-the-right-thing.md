# An Obligation to Do The Right Thing

> Date: 2025-05-13

Some words of encouragement I sent to my best friend (Phil) as he weighs the decision to take on position of operational manager on our contract:

I’ve been thinking about our conversation more, and I wanted to take the time to give you a more well thought out response. As you know, I’m definitely not a think on the seat of your pants person when it comes to interpersonal / soft skill communication.

To say the last 4-5 years hasn’t had a substantial toll on me would be incredibly insincere. When I think back to all of the effort and struggle that went into getting this project to where it is today, I’m overwhelmed by moments that make me incredibly proud, incredibly humbled, and incredibly ashamed. The bounds between the highs and the lows have been monumental, but that’s always going to be the case when you’re striving to achieve greatness.

For what I choose to be the better, this project has put me through trials and tribulations I never believed I was equipped to handle. It’s given me a sense of perspective and development that no other position ever would have, and I now know what I am capable of achieving. The stakes of not giving my all to achieve what I am capable of is too grim to bear.

That is the weight of what these positions entail. Looking the hardest problems, seemingly doomed but too critical to fail, straight in the face and saying “I will give you more of myself than I can bear because it means too much.”

You know and understand this all too well because you have been there with me from day one. You’ve given every part of your patience and grace to help me drive this thing to the goal post. Of all the people I’ve worked and served with, I’ve never met someone more committed to accomplishing excellence in pursuit of the mission.

To lead this team and to accept responsibility for its success or failure is not something anyone can just do; you have to have been there, to have given your all to it, and to know that no matter what happens, you gave it your best. 

There’s only a few of us who can say that, and I think we owe it to ourselves to be able to apply our talents to advocating on our own behalf. There’s too much work to do for us to continue to beat our heads against failure from others.
