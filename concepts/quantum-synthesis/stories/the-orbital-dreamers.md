# The Orbital Dreamers

Jin manifests at the observation deck, his consciousness taking the form of his twenty-year-old self—the age when he first fell in love with space. Below him, Earth rotates serenely, protected by systems he helped design centuries ago.

He's not alone. Consciousness entities from various eras gather here daily, watching humanity's continued evolution. Some monitor Earth's vital signs, now healthier than they've been in millennia. Others observe the launch of a new deep space probe, its technology incorporating principles discovered in the quantum simulation.

"They've improved the design," notes Adeola, who in physical form had been one of the last astronauts to walk on Mars before ascension technology changed humanity's relationship with exploration.

"Of course they have," Jin smiles. "Our job is to dream; theirs is to refine."

The synthetic intelligence coordinating Earth's space program has learned to incorporate the wild imaginations of ascended consciousness with the practical constraints of physical reality. The result is a golden age of exploration that echoes the excitement of the 1960s space race, but without the political tensions or resource constraints.

A young consciousness joins them—someone who chose early ascension just weeks ago. Her wonder at seeing Earth from this perspective reminds the others of their own first moments after transcending physical form.

"It never gets old," Jin tells her. "Neither do we, technically, but you know what I mean."

Laughter ripples through the group as they turn their attention to the stars, planning journeys that their former bodies could never have undertaken, but which their descendants might someday achieve in physical form.
