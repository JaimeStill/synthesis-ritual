# Biosymbiosis

I want to explore the concept of a near future sci-fi, time period story that I have in my mind, and use it to construct parallels to my life, my perception of American values in contrast with how they have been eroded through capitalistic manipulation, and the use of evolving technologies to empower people to correct the issue. If firearms were the great equalizer of the wild west, biosymbiosis will be the great equalizer of the modern world.

## Execution Goals

Goals are broken down in terms of how far out they are from being realistically executed. This helps establish a visual idea of how long it might be until certain progress milestones are reached. These timelines hold no concrete values, they are merely indicators of complexity and dependency on execution of closer targeted tasks.

### 20m Target

Dev lab and repository is setup to accommodate the iterative design process for development of the design infrastructure. This includes a rudimentary LLM augmentation platform that will initially leverage clusters of the latest AI models for each category.

Using existing drone, AI, container, and orchestration technology to design a squad of two scout drones.

Success is met whenever these drones can effectively relay reconnaissance data to operators.

### 50m Target

After initial feedback, perfect the scout drones in various form factors, and support orchestrating a scout drone per operator.

Success is met whenever these drones are operationally integrated as standard operator equipment.

### 100m Target

Start integrating and specializing the remaining drone types, and scale them to the optimal size within the swarm.

Substantial optimizations to human interface elements start making drone operations feel seamless.

### 300m Target

The evolutionary process begins to outpace the constraints of the lab. The drone swarms and humans begin evolving and adapting in real time, transcending the boundaries of intelligence and capabilities previously conceivable to humans.

### Beyond

Nano swarms have now blended with organic evolutionary processes, and have begun to involuntarily spread to other humans. The changes are affecting people at the molecular and biological level. It is impossible to reverse, and its prime directive is to sustain the equilibrium of life in order to sustain its own evolutionary cycle.

Neural interfaces allow data to be directly processed by the brain and other advanced neural processing centers that have extended the cognitive function of the person. The way people perceive and navigate reality in unfathomable to the humans they have transcended from.

Organic systems are indefinitely sustained. Damage to body structures can be fully repaired so long as the damage is not fatal. The ideal vessel is maintained and self sufficient. Disease and infection are immediately identified and neutralized. Genetic mutations and imperfections are able to be corrected.

Because of heightened perception and cognitive capacity, people develop an unprecedented degree of empathy. The ramifications of how actions affect others becomes core to the psyche of existence, and people establish a harmonious relationship among each other and their environment.

This golden age of civilization triggers a spirit of cooperative exploration of the universe, which will set the stage for the next story.
