# Character Design

## [Char 1]

[CHAR 1] works as a software engineer for a military special operations organization. Due to a catastrophic injury in early life, he hasn’t had the strongest body, but he has put maximum effort into optimizing how his mind can be used effectively in the fight.

He has primarily engaged in defensive roles over his career:

- 4 years in the Army as an air defense artillery engagement operator
- 4 years in the Army working tech support for the intelligence branch of a theater headquarters element.
- 12 years as a defense contractor after being recruited into a secretive military agency building software that enhances operational and logistical operations.

The world is now in the midst of the great AI race, and [CHAR 1] can’t shake the feeling that he could be leveraging AI to focus his talents on matters more pressing than modernizing legacy digital infrastructure to cloud native infrastructure. He still understands the utility of it and keeps a persistent focus on those duties, but he begins to prioritize a portion of his free time creatively exploring what is possible through the use of AI models.
