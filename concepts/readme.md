# Concepts

`concepts` serves as a collecting ground for emergent thoughts, inspirations, and theoretical explorations. Ideas here may be incomplete, experimental, or in early stages of development.

## Structure

Concepts are initially structured as loose files, or collections of files embedded in a subdirectory, organized into a category.

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep concept documents focused on a single idea or closely related cluster of ideas.
- Use plain text or markdown for maximum accessibility.
