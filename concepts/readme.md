# Concepts

`concepts` serves as a collecting ground for emergent thoughts, inspirations, and theoretical explorations. Ideas here may be incomplete, experimental, or in early stages of development.

## Structure

Concepts are initially structured as loose files in the root of the directory. Whenever an idea becomes more fully fleshed out and associated with an [`artifact`](../artifacts/), it will be archived into a sub-directory named after the artifact.

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep concept documents focused on a single idea or closely related cluster of ideas.
- Use plain text or markdown for maximum accessibility.
- Include context on whether the concept relates to existing infrastructure elsewhere in the repository.
- Tag concepts appropriately to facilitate cross-referencing and synthesis.

When a concept matures or combines with others to form a more coherent whole, it will develop into an artifact.
