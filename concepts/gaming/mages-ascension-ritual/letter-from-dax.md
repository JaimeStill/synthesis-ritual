# A Letter From Dax

A letter dispatch arrives for the Headmaster of the Telin Arcanum bearing the unmistakable seal of a Mage Academy in nearby Ammanet.

Breaking the seal, Dagon is surprised to find secret letter from Dax contained within the impeccable forgery.

The letter states:

Dagon,

Allow me first to apologize for the presumption of my deceptive epistle...but I believe that once you have read it in full, and understood the nature of my earnest request, you will agree that this slight subterfuge was prudent. 

I do hope this letter finds you in good health and with a glad heart. My sources inform me that you are leading the venerable Telin Arcanum with a sagacious hand, rivaling that of even Semang Drav, your predecessor and teacher (may he rest peacefully). I tell them that of course you are, as I was a direct witness to your wisdom and skill when we both travelled together in the Onyx Dawn. I tell you, Dagon, not a day passes without my fond remembrance of those journeys. But, as the Headmaster of the Telin Arcanum, I know that your duties are many and your days long, so I will attempt to be brief.    

I speak now of the past, of days that seem at once so distant and yet so near. You will recall a certain Mordecai Trigg, previously a Guard Captain in Eaton, later a Captain of the Auxilia force in Honeyrest. Long ago he robbed me of someone most dear, my Evie, and set me upon a red road of vengeance that, with the assistance of the Onyx Dawn, ended near a small hut in Vostoy. That night we repaid Trigg, with interest, using the only coin that men like him understand...extreme violence. Even his worthless remains were later put to use during our subsequent dealings with the Witch of Blavorkin (yes, Dagon...THAT witch) and the resurrection of Queen Calantha Niese (even now my mind reels at what I witnessed that night). 

And it is to that event I now make reference. Before we accepted the Witch's terms, we concurred that we must first speak to the Queen, to see what she would have us do...and we did. Through some eldritch marvel I can't possibly hope to understand, Bannick actually achieved this for us...and the Queen agreed. But what is the nexus between this event and my request? Only this, my friend...I thought that destroying Trigg would bring me peace but, alas, it has not. I need...I MUST..speak with Evie, though I know not how. These matters are simply beyond my ken. 

Thus I have run the gauntlet through the Halls of the Divine for assistance, starting with the Church of Eldath...but their responses to my entreaty ranged from sympathy and condolences to rage and cries of blasphemy but all with the same ultimate answer: "No". I despaired for a while, often finding what little respite I could in the bottom of numerous bottles through the interminable nights...until I remembered THAT night and the dark miracles that occurred...and I contemplated all of the things that could be possible if one has the courage and knowledge to look where others dare not.

Now, to the request, as I have already taken more of your time than I intended. I would have attempted to submit my queries to Bannick but he is lost to us for now. However, your knowledge of all things arcane, and other esoteric domains, I suspect, is unsurpassed. Thus if you are amenable to granting a brief audience to an old companion to discuss this topic in confidence, he would be most grateful. If not, that is completely understandable and he will remain, for all time...  

Your friend,

Dax
