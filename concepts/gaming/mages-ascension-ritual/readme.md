# Mage's Ascension Ritual: Traversing the Tree of Life

> LLM: Claude 3.7 Sonnet  
> Date: 2025-04-26

I’ve been a part of a long-running Dungeons and Dragons 5e campaign, and I would like some help creating the mechanics for a single session encounter.

## Background

I am a powerful mage named Dagon who is nearing the end of his life due to a curse from a powerful shadow goddess. I’m the headmaster of the most powerful school for arcane arts in all of the lands called the Tellum Arcanum. I have a rogue friend named Dax who is a high ranking member of the elite Thieves Guild.

We are currently preparing for a major war that is going to break out, and I have been busy preparing the Tellum Arcanum with every ounce of strength I have left. This evening, I received a letter from Dax requesting assistance in any way I know how to contact his deceased sister Evie. After reading his letter, I thought of a story arc that would be incredible to engage in as Dagon’s final adventure.

## Ascension Ritual

What follows is the scenario I wrote to our DM after reading the letter received from Dax:

I spent several years studying and practicing ritual magick. The Tree of Life / Kabbalah is a concept used as a sort of spiritual map to guide magi in their journey towards spiritual ascension. We exist at the root in the realm (sephiroth) of Malkuth, and most people never ascend beyond that realm. One of the great goals of a practicing magi is to ascend the tree of life, cross the abyss (the broken sephiroth known as Da’ath), and ascend to the source of all light.

Each sephiroth is characterized by different virtues and vices that you must embody and overcome in order to transcend it. I think it would be interesting for Dagon and Dax to undergo a gamified version of an ascension ritual (you don’t even have to use any of the official verbiage, just presenting the attached image to help visualize).

They must work together to ascend the tree of life, cross the abyss, and return to the source of light in order for Dax to find Evie. This journey would ultimately result in Dagon not being able to leave the source because of his weakened life force. However, Dagon would impart his arcane abilities to Dax as a means of providing a final contribution to the coming war. This would cause Dax to evolve from being a traditional rogue into a powerful stealth mage.

## Request

Help me design game session mechanics focused around executing the ascension ritual, having Dagon guide Dax through the ritual to reach the source and contact Evie. I’m only concerned with the mechanics of the ritual itself, please do not concern yourself with trying to write any of the story elements. Essentially, the ritual should consist of completing a trial to ascend each sephiroth in the tree of life, crossing the abyss of Da’ath, and entering the source realm.

## Response

I'd be happy to help you design game mechanics for an ascension ritual based on the Tree of Life! This sounds like a fascinating final adventure for your character Dagon, guiding Dax through the sephiroth to reach the source and contact his sister Evie. Let me create mechanics focused purely on the ritual itself.

# Ascension Ritual Mechanics: Climbing the Tree of Life

## Core Mechanics

1. **Sephiroth Trials**: Each sephiroth requires completing a trial that embodies its essence

## DM Tools

### Ritual Energy Tracking
- Start with 0-2 points based on preparation
- Maximum capacity: 10 points
- Critical threshold for final stage: 7+ points
- If energy reaches 0 during ritual: immediate collapse and 4d10 psychic damage

### Time Pressure Mechanics
- Dagon's life force: Track with a separate pool of "life points" (equal to Constitution score)
- Each failed check: -1 life point
- Each sephiroth completed: -1 life point
- If life points reach 0 before completion: Dagon collapses, ritual fails

### Reward System
- For each sephiroth mastered: Grant Dax one insight about arcane magic
- Upon completion: Dax gains 3 cantrips and 2 1st-level spell slots
- Full success: Dax becomes an Arcane Trickster with expanded spell options

This mechanical framework provides a structured, challenging ritual with meaningful stakes and rewards that fits your narrative goals. The DM can adjust difficulty checks based on character levels and add narrative elements as needed.
