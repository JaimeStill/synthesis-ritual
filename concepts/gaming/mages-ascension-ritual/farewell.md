# Farewell

My Brothers,

I wish you all the best and appreciate the bonds that were forged in the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of excellence. A group of friends will get you to places you could never fathom on your own. Continue to care for and guide each other through all of the trials ahead, and never neglect to make time to pause and enjoy the moments together.

Remember who you desire to be when the war is over, and apply it still so that you do not lose yourselves to the chaos. In the final moments of life, you get the chance to look back and recognize what you have been through and where it has lead you. Through this reflection, I acknowledge that this growth I experienced in this phase of my evolution was only possible because you picked me up when I stumbled.

The actions I have set in motion are purely inspired by your honor and brotherhood. I can shed this mortal coil knowing that my life had purpose and I did not waste it. Now go brothers, and leave behind a legacy worth fighting for. We will tell tale of the legends from the camp fires of eternity beyond this realm.

Through The Abyss,
Dagon
