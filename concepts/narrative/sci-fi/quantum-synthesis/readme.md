# Quantum Synthesis

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- [**foundations**](./foundations/) - contains individual concepts that describe details about the narrative world.
- [**stories**](./stories/) - contain developing story ideas that bring life and character to the narrative world.
- [`analysis.md`](./analysis.md) - provides recommendations for optimizations through analysis.
- [`characters.md`](./characters.md) - establishes character sheets for all of the established main characters.
- [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) - serves as a definitive reference for the key concepts, technologies, and terminology used throughout the Quantum Synthesis narrative world.
- [`origin.md`](./origin.md) - the prompt sequence that initially conceptualized the idea.
- [`overview.md`](./overview.md) - provides a thematic overview of the primary details.
- [`specifications.md`](./specifications.md) - analyzes the contents of the concept and provides documentation illustrating the details of any technologies and scientific concepts.
- [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) - presents a unified timeline of events in the Quantum Synthesis world, from near-future developments to the far-future evolution of consciousness. Events are organized chronologically to provide context for stories and concepts throughout the repository.
- [`update.md`](./update.md) - a prompt that automates the triggering of artifacts for the following documents: `analysis`, `glossary`, `overview`, `specifications`, and `timeline`.
