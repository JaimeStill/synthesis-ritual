# Approach

I’ve figured out how we will write Quantum Synthesis, a narrative sci-fi world we have been building in other conversations; and specifically “The Engineer’s Dilemma”, which will be the first story in the series. We will host coding sessions set in a fictional world where the dialog of our conversation are entries to the story. A prompt will be engineered to review and clean up the details of the output that is curated from the conversation. I will assist with that by providing administrative commands that indicate a contextual action, such as ignoring a previous prompt or capturing a prompt as being important to the output.

## Response

The Quantum Synthesis approach is intriguing - using development sessions as narrative scaffolding where technical problem-solving becomes character development, and the iterative refinement process becomes part of the world-building. The administrative command structure you're considering could create clean separation between the raw collaborative process and the curated narrative output.

## Tasks

- Capture starred Claude conversations and build upon this approach.
