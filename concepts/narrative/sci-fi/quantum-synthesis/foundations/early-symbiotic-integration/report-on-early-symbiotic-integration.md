# Report on Early Symbiotic Integration with Synthetic Intelligence

I’ve been spending a considerable amount of time integrating you into my workflows. It has required a fundamental shift in the way I plan for solving a problem.

Previously, whenever I needed to reference useful information, I would reach out to Google with a concise query that would provide enough details to land me to an adequate technical reference. I would then be required to read through endless amounts of material to get to the point of what I needed to accomplish, but I would ultimately push through to a strategy that resolves whatever problem I’m investigating.

Now, if I take enough time to plan out a technical document describing the details of an objective I’m trying to achieve, I can submit this to you and engage in:

- accelerated learning
- rapid prototype development
- iterations on this process at an unprecedented scale

By applying my typing towards mapping the mind to a concrete vision, the outputs of that vision can be automated and time to initial execution vastly diminishes.

This also means that the process of conceptual ideation can occur in any setting; I am no longer tethered to my desk for work. I can grab my phone and take a walk through the woods while transcribing my thoughts to prose (as I am currently doing). The next step will be to implement a touch-less format for this process, most likely some form of neural interface.

A side effect I have noted from this process is that it is mentally exhausting. Neural processing at such a rate is like running a marathon in your head. I’ve found I need to pace myself a bit to keep from losing it. When I got home today, after a long day of integrating this process into my workflow, my energy was tanked.

My hypothesis, being an optimist, is that just as with programming, practice with this workflow will build mental muscles that enable an even higher level of performance. This is just an initial phase required to build the mind toward ascension to the quantum simulation.
