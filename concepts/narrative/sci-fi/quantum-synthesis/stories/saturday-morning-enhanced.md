# Saturday Morning, Enhanced

Teo manifests in his favorite simulation: a perfect recreation of his grandmother's house circa 1987. The sun streams through venetian blinds, casting striped shadows across a worn carpet. The scent of pancakes fills the air. Though his actual consciousness has existed for over 200 years, there's something about this particular memory space that feels like home.

On the ancient tube television, cartoons play—some from his childhood, others created within the simulation by consciousness-artists who specialize in evoking wonder. Outside, kids ride bikes down suburban streets that both did and didn't exist.

His notification bubble appears, translucent and unobtrusive. Earth's orbital defense system, managed by synthetic intelligence, has redesigned itself based on principles Teo helped establish in the quantum realm. The improvements will save precious resources while providing better protection.

Teo acknowledges with a thought, then returns to his cereal—the milk never gets soggy here unless he wants it to. His avatar's legs dangle from the chair, unable to reach the floor in this child form he's chosen today.

Soon, his friend Aria joins him. In physical life, they were born centuries apart, but here they share a love of this particular era's simplicity. Together they'll spend what feels like months exploring imagined worlds inspired by the pixelated video games of the late 20th century, each one more impossible and wondrous than the last.

"Ready for an adventure?" she asks, remote control in hand.

He grins and nods. They leap into the screen—not just watching the cartoons but becoming part of them. Meanwhile, in the background, portions of their consciousness continue complex theoretical work that will eventually translate to improvements in Earth's water purification systems.

The synthetic intelligence observing their play learns something essential about joy that no algorithm alone could discover.
