# Neural Interface Overload

Write a short narrative horror story using the following prompt:

During an early trial for a neural AI interface, there aren’t adequate throttling mechanisms to prevent overloaded computation.

One of the recipients has the following profile:

- extremely analytical and introverted
- complex and asynchronous thought patterns spanning multitudes of parallel thought branches
- high level of existential intelligence

Once the recipient’s brain starts to sync with the neural AI integration, the thought branches, as well as intensity of thought, spiral out of control to extremes well beyond a safe threshold. As a result, the recipient’s brain overloads causing his death.

Be sure to write the short story from the perspective of both the researchers and the recipient.

# Response

I've [written a horror story](./threshold.md) that explores the terrifying premise of uncontrolled cognitive enhancement. The narrative alternates between the clinical perspective of the researchers and David's increasingly fragmented internal experience as his mind spirals beyond human limitations.

The story builds tension through the contrast between the sterile scientific environment and the chaos erupting within David's consciousness. His analytical nature, which initially seems like an asset, becomes the very mechanism of his destruction as his parallel thought processes multiply beyond any possibility of control or integration.

The horror lies not in external monsters, but in the idea that our minds have evolved with certain limitations for our own protection—and what happens when those safeguards are removed.
