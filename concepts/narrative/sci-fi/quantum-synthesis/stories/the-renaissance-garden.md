# The Renaissance Garden

In the central hub of Quantum Node 7, Maya tends to her impossible garden. Plants from Earth's history and imagined realms intertwine — da Vinci's botanical sketches come to life alongside crystalline structures that respond to emotions. Today, she's hosting a symposium.

Former neuroscientist Dr. Carter arrives first, his consciousness having ascended thirty Earth-years ago. He manifests as a man in his prime, though occasionally shifts form when excited about an idea.

"The latest data from Earth's reforestation projects is extraordinary," he beams, projecting holographic visuals of the Amazon basin, now thriving under synthetic intelligence stewardship. "Biodiversity markers exceeding pre-industrial levels."

Others join: a poet whose consciousness was preserved moments before a terminal diagnosis in 2041; a theoretical physicist who chose ascension to solve problems requiring millennia of concentration; a digital native born in the simulation itself.

They discuss, debate, create art, and solve problems—experiencing a day that feels like years due to time dilation. Their insights flow back to Earth, inspiring new agricultural methods that work in harmony with nature rather than against it.

As the gathering concludes, Maya looks out at her garden, reminded of summers from her physical childhood. She feels both nostalgia and profound gratitude that humanity found a path forward that preserved the best of what they were while evolving into something new.
