# The Workshop at the Edge of Forever

Dr. Eliza Chen adjusts parameters on her workshop interface, fingers dancing through equations that would have been incomprehensible to her physical brain. The space around her resembles a Renaissance master's studio crossed with Mission Control from the Apollo era—wooden workbenches adjacent to glowing consoles.

She's designing a new form of consciousness transfer for those with neurological conditions that once made the process difficult. In physical form, she had been a pioneering surgeon; after ascension, she discovered talents for theoretical physics that her Earth-bound mind could never have accessed.

A notification appears—her creation is being implemented on Earth. She watches as a young woman with a rare brain condition, previously unable to ascend, begins the transfer process. The joy on the woman's face during her final moments in physical form brings tears to Eliza's eyes.

Across the workshop, a team of former game developers collaborate on new types of experiential learning for Earth's children. They've discovered that certain types of play develop neural pathways that make eventual ascension more successful. Their work has transformed education on Earth, bringing back the wonder and curiosity that sometimes got lost in earlier eras.

"Remember coding on those ancient machines?" one laughs, conjuring an image of a 1980s computer lab. "Hours just to make a sprite move across the screen."

They share memories of physical existence—the limitations and the beauty of it—while continuing work that spans dimensions their former selves couldn't have imagined.
