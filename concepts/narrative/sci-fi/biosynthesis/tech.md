# Tech Design

[CHAR 1] builds a design document outlining an experiment that aims to replace team dogs with drones that operate in sync with a team of operators. Each drone serves unique purposes, but they operate as a singular unit. They are what the brass refer to as a force multiplier.

## Initilal Drone Designs

- **Scout drones** are used to conduct reconnaissance of areas undetected by enemy forces.
- **Sigint drones** are used to identify important communications signals in the area of operation.
- **Defensive drones** are focused on preserving the life of the operators. They relay critical data in the midst of an operation, and have limited kinetic and cyber countermeasures against attacks.
- **Offensive drones** operate in attack formations and autonomously target adversary drones. They will only engage organic targets under orders from operators themselves.

## LLM Augmented Design

The design document outlines the idea of starting with drone designs based around current form factor technology, and developing specialized  LLMs assigned to evolve the available form factors and integrated capabilities as requested by subsequent design iterations. These LLM specialties can be networked together so that innovations in one specialty can cross pollinate to other specialties, yielding a continuous feedback loop of evolution.

The initially conceived LLM categories are indicated in the sections that follow:

### Hardware Engineer

- designs how the suite of available components can be organized to form the structure of a drone.
- optimizes tradeoffs in form configurations based on the parameters of anticipated operating environments.
- creatively evolving how hardware is utilized for optimal power and efficiency.
- providing enhancements to how and where energy is sourced and stored to ensure optimal power is provided in the smallest form factor possible.
- optimizing assembly-level hardware drivers.

### Scientist

- considers how cyber and organic technology can be augmented for optimal integrative efficiency.
- creates protocols for forming and routing signals between cybernetic and organic components.

### Defensive Systems Engineer

- focused on evolving defensive sensors, as well as cybernetic and kinetic countermeasures.
- manages the api interfaces between these components and the underlying platform.

### Offensive Systems Engineer

- focused on evolving offensive sensors, as well as cybernetic and kineric weapons.
- manages the api interfaces between these components and the underlying platform.

### Network Engineer

- responsible for designing and maintaining the peer networking protocols and interfaces that allow each operational element to send and receive information.
- ensures resilience and security of traffic.

### Platform Engineer

- designs and maintains the underlying operating system that each component sits on top of, and allows them all to interoperate.

### Human Interface Engineer

- designs and maintains the interface devices that are used by operators to receive and process drone data.

### Form Factor Engineer

- designs how the suite of available components can be organized to form the structure of a drone.
- optimizes tradeoffs in form configurations based on the parameters of anticipated operating environments
