# README Files for Synthesis-Ritual Repository Structure

## concepts/README.md

```markdown
# Concepts

This directory contains initial raw ideas that form the foundation of the Synthesis-Ritual framework. 

## Purpose

The `concepts` directory serves as a collecting ground for emergent thoughts, inspirations, and theoretical explorations. Ideas here may be incomplete, experimental, or in early stages of development.

## Structure

Consider organizing concepts into thematic subdirectories as the collection grows:

- `tech/` - Technology-focused concepts
- `mind/` - Consciousness and cognition explorations
- `eco/` - Ecological and symbiotic relationships
- `meta/` - Philosophical foundations and frameworks

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep concept documents focused on a single idea or closely related cluster of ideas
- Use plain text or markdown for maximum accessibility
- Include context on how the concept relates to the broader Synthesis-Ritual framework
- Tag concepts appropriately to facilitate cross-referencing and synthesis

When a concept matures or combines with others to form a more coherent whole, consider moving it to the `artifacts` directory.
```

## artifacts/README.md

```markdown
# Artifacts

This directory contains more developed iterations of ideas that have progressed beyond the initial concept stage.

## Purpose

The `artifacts` directory houses works that represent the materialization of concepts into more structured and comprehensive forms. Artifacts are the bridge between raw ideas and finalized implementations.

## Structure

Artifacts can be organized in various ways depending on their nature:

- By theme or domain
- By development stage
- By intended application

## Characteristics of Artifacts

Artifacts typically:
- Synthesize multiple concepts into coherent frameworks
- Have defined boundaries and scope
- Include detailed documentation of their evolution
- May incorporate feedback and iterations
- Represent significant development beyond the concept stage

When an artifact reaches a state of completion where it represents a finalized work ready for implementation or distribution, consider moving it to the `codex` directory.
```

## lab/README.md

```markdown
# Lab

This directory hosts a collection of experiments for exploring code-based concepts and practical implementations.

## Purpose

The `lab` directory serves as a workspace for testing, prototyping, and simulating ideas from the Synthesis-Ritual framework. It provides a controlled environment to validate concepts and develop artifacts through practical application.

## Structure

Each experiment should be contained within its own subdirectory and include:

- Source code
- Documentation explaining the purpose and methodology
- Instructions for running/replicating the experiment
- Results and observations
- References to related concepts and artifacts

## Experiment Guidelines

- Keep experiments focused on testing specific hypotheses
- Document dependencies and environment setup clearly
- Maintain separation between experiments to prevent interference
- Include analysis of results and implications for the broader framework

Successful experiments may evolve into artifacts or contribute directly to entries in the codex.

## codex/README.md

```markdown
# Codex

This directory contains the collection of finalized, refined works representing the culmination of the Synthesis-Ritual framework.

## Purpose

The `codex` serves as the definitive repository of completed works that embody the principles and practices of Synthesis-Ritual. Items in the codex represent fully realized expressions of concepts that have been developed, tested, and refined.

## Characteristics of Codex Entries

Entries in the codex typically:
- Represent complete, self-contained works
- Have undergone thorough development and refinement
- Are ready for implementation, distribution, or application
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Embody the core principles of the Synthesis-Ritual framework

## Structure

The codex may be organized into categories such as:

- Methodologies and practices
- Frameworks and models
- Tools and applications
- Comprehensive analyses
- Ritual procedures and protocols

## Usage Guidelines

- Maintain version control for codex entries as they continue to evolve
- Include reference lists connecting to originating concepts and artifacts
- Document the full lineage and development history of each entry
- Provide clear guidelines for application and implementation
