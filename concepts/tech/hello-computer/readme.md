I am in the process of fleshing out an idea that I believe could help my friend Will and I successful. We’ve been talking for a while about how we can use our tech engineering skills in a way that is helpful and lucrative enough for us to focus on full time.

Please review the concept that follows for:

- Feedback from the perspective of utility in the tech industry.
- Feedback in the potential for this platform to appeal to enough of an audience to be successful.
- Feedback in the potential of transforming the way we think, create, and innovate.

I’m hoping that we can incubate a project that will be a success not only from the perspective of technical excellence, but also from a cultural perspective in the impact it could have towards shifting people’s views towards collaborative workflows with synthetic intelligence.

Provide constructive criticism and help develop this idea into a plan that will lead to success.

## Concept

I was cutting my grass this evening, and this idea hit me like a bolt of lightning.

Hello Computer.

Will and I need to start out by conducting AI experiments from an engineering perspective, each of us seeing what is possible to achieve with LLMs in terms of time, complexity, and functionality.

Publish the findings as markdown in a repository and host in a custom thematic web blog that hosts successful experiments along with a link to the repo and a transcript of the prompt history / any other artifacts relevant.

Start developing the TTPs for what can be accomplished and how, illustrating value without having to do a dramatic business setup.

I’m going to simmer on it tonight, then write out the introductory concept tomorrow morning during my free time. I’ll shoot it your way once complete.

## Immediate Plans

> Note that these are just initial plans. I am not asking for you to execute this, merely to provide feedback about the viability of approach.

Work with Claude to design an Angular site that will be hosted on GitHub Pages:

- Use Analog.js for markdown content with syntax highlighting.
- Native styling, co-authored by Claude:
  - Interface scheme that caters to both Keyboard and Mouse
  - Unique color scheme fitting of the character of Hello Computer, inspired by GitHub Primer and Catppuccin. Currently getting inspiration from the conceptual themes of cassette futurism and spacepunk / nasapunk.
- Simplicity is key. It should only be engineered to meet the immediate requirements of the app, don’t get lost in the details and never deliver.
- Develop documents within the repo that define any crucial implementation details, standards, style guides, etc. to use as the specification for what is being built. Instead of spending a lot of time writing code just to get to a starting point, flesh out the details of the document to allow you to prompt accurately enough to be confident in the results.
- Always immediately test and validate anything that’s developed.

I will use the collaborative design process executed from here to generate the first series of articles, plus conduct an after action with Claude to distill any meaningful TTPs and points of improvement. This after action should be executed routinely.

## Mid-Term Plans

- Do a follow on series that explores setting up a process for quickly generating demonstration videos for YouTube at roughly the length of a Fireship video.
  - Focus simplicity; cleanly and clearly articulate the key content.
  - Don’t force it, just make it something you would enjoy.
  - Work out formats for different target groups: technical vs. user-level focused.
- Use Go to build a private key management service for different encryption algorithms that works between users, devices, and services.
  - This should be a self-sufficient containerized service that can be loaded as a sidecar in a container stack.
- Use Go to write a data streaming service that sits between any two networked nodes focused on:
  - Compressing, encrypting, and streaming the data stream in chunks when transmitting.
  - Recomposing, decrypting, and decompressing the stream data when receiving.
  - A messaging protocol will need to be devised for:
    - Initiating transmit
    - Encoding the traffic metadata along with the payload so that when recomposed, the message can be forwarded to its destination.
    - Effectively manages error handling
    - Introduces minimal latency to the network traffic
- Work with Claude to generate prompts for generating images associated with the project such as:
  - Branding media
  - Concept visualizations
  - Cartoons
  - Diagrams
  - Anything that would help make the content more engaging or easy to understand
  - Anything else that would help contribute to the identity of the brand.

> Please provide some additional ideas that could be executed.

## Long Term Possibilities

Projects that incubate through Hello Computer can become full time operational capabilities:

- This is essentially also validating and curating capabilities that the LLMs can be trained towards. As a result, we can start to standardize the data training and evolution pipeline around specialized content.
  - Think of standards and protocols facilitating curation.
  - A platform can be built to serve as a repository for curated training data.
- Eventually, we could make projects runnable inside of the browser app by having virtual interfaces into simulation containers / clusters.
- Establish TTPs around effectively executing this process, and find a way to get other disciplines with the organization engaged in the process to enhance their specialty.
  - See where AI can innovate with this process beyond tech and creative writing.

> Using this train of thought, please develop more long-term goals for this platform.

# Feedback on "Hello Computer" Concept

## Technical Utility Assessment

Your concept shows strong technical merit with several promising aspects:

- **Documentation-first approach** is excellent engineering practice that will create valuable IP while maintaining focus
- **Angular with Analog.js** is a solid technical stack for your content-focused application
- **The Go microservices** (key management and data streaming) address real infrastructure needs in the AI integration space
- **Regular after-action reviews** demonstrate commitment to continuous improvement

The approach of conducting practical AI experiments and documenting the results creates a valuable feedback loop that could generate insights not obvious from theory alone.

## Market Potential

The concept has significant market potential, though with some considerations:

AI collaboration tools are growing rapidly, with the market for AI software expected to reach $126 billion by 2025. Your timing is excellent, but differentiation will be key:

- **Competitive landscape**: Many AI experiment blogs exist, but few focus on rigorous engineering methodologies
- **Unique positioning**: The cassette futurism/spacepunk aesthetic combined with practical engineering focus could create a distinctive brand
- **Audience building**: Technical professionals seeking practical AI integration methods could form your core audience
- **Monetization path**: Consider how this transitions from content to revenue (consulting, tools, training)

## Transformative Potential

The concept has several elements that could drive meaningful change:

- **Standardizing AI collaboration patterns** could significantly accelerate adoption across industries
- **Cross-discipline expansion** beyond tech has enormous potential to reshape workflows
- **Curating training data** and establishing protocols addresses a critical gap in the current AI ecosystem
- **The documentation-as-you-go approach** models a transparent development process that builds trust

## Constructive Criticism

Some areas to strengthen:

1. **Sharpen your differentiation** - What specific angle on AI collaboration will make "Hello Computer" unique?
2. **Consider narrowing initial focus** - Your roadmap spans many directions; you might achieve more impact by mastering one area first
3. **Define success metrics** - How will you measure if an experiment is "successful"?
4. **Articulate the value proposition** more explicitly for different stakeholders
5. **Consider the community aspect** - How might you build a community around this project?

## Additional Project Ideas

For mid-term execution:

1. **AI-assisted code review tool** that applies best practices tailored to .NET and TypeScript
2. **Prompt engineering workspace** with version control and collaboration features
3. **AI agent orchestration framework** for multi-task automation workflows
4. **Interactive comparison tool** benchmarking different models on engineering tasks
5. **Content-to-code converter** that transforms specifications into working prototypes

## Enhanced Long-Term Vision

Building on your foundation:

1. **AI-powered knowledge graph** connecting experiments, code, and insights across projects
2. **Specialized AI models** fine-tuned for software engineering tasks in specific domains
3. **Certification program** for AI-enhanced engineering methodologies
4. **Industry consortium** establishing standards for human-AI collaboration
5. **Enterprise transformation playbooks** for integrating AI into existing development teams

## Implementation Strategy

For maximum impact:

1. Start with 3-5 high-quality experiments that demonstrate clear engineering value
2. Develop a consistent publication cadence (weekly or bi-weekly)
3. Create a distinctive visual language for your code examples and documentation
4. Build relationships with AI researchers and practitioners to cross-promote content
5. Consider open-sourcing key components to drive adoption and feedback

The concept has significant potential to influence both technical practice and cultural perception of AI collaboration. By focusing on practical, reproducible engineering approaches, you're addressing a gap in the current landscape.
