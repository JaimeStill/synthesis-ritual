# Cosmodrome

I'm revisiting the `retro orbit` design system, and I would like to condense it down to a single dark theme and a single light theme. This design palette will primarily be used for web apps, so I really only need to focus on maintaining two distinct themes. Remember, throughout this exercise, the most critically important thing is to stay true to the originally conceived aesthetic: retro futurism and NASA punk.

## Initial Instinct

My initial instinct is that I would like to simplify as follows:

- For the dark theme, use the **Base Colors** from Apollo with the **Accent & Contrast** colors from Voyager. Rename to Apollo.
- For the light theme, use the **Base Colors** from Launchpad with the **Accent & Contrast** colors from Horizon. Rename to Horizon.

I like the selected base colors because they are more neutrally skewed.

The accent & contrast color selection feels a bit less important to me. What initially drove me to these selections is that the colors feel more vibrant, but I also don't have a frame of reference for how they fit into the overall aesthetic.

## Instructions

Review these adjustments from the perspective of a graphics designer with a deep understanding of color theory, accessibility, and a love for retro futurism and NASA punk aesthetics. Take my initial instincts as advice, but use your best judgment for selecting the optimum colors for the following criteria:

- fit into the desired aesthetic
- optimal accessibility
- neutral-oriented base colors
- fit with the design philosophy of the design system

Additionally, provide a set of candidates for renaming the design system. While I initially liked `retro orbit`, I think we can do a bit better with a single-term name that captures the essence of the aesthetic.

Output the results into a new artifact that defines the design system specification in a clear and concise way.

# Cosmodrome Design System

After reviewing the RetroOrbit design system, I've condensed it into [a more focused system](./cosmodrome-design-system.md) with two themes that maintain the retro futurism and NASA punk aesthetic. The combination prioritizes accessibility, visual harmony, and stays true to the original design philosophy.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Colorful is better than colorless**: Colors help distinguish between elements and make structures clearer
2. **There should be balance**: Not too dull, not too bright - colors that work well in various lighting conditions
3. **Harmony is superior to dissonance**: Vibrant colors that complement each other within a cohesive theme

## Theme Overview

### Apollo (Dark Theme)

A dark theme combining the warm, vintage feel of Apollo-era mission control rooms with vibrant accent colors inspired by retro sci-fi interfaces and NASA control panels.

### Horizon (Light Theme)

A light theme merging the technical precision of engineering blueprints with the optimistic palette of Space Age promotional materials and retrofuturistic illustrations.

## System Naming Candidates

After analyzing the design system and its aesthetic goals, here are some strong candidates for renaming from "RetroOrbit" to a single-term name that better captures the essence:

1. **Cosmodrome** (recommended) - Soviet space program term that perfectly encapsulates retro space aesthetics with a technical edge
2. **Astrotech** - Combines astronomical elements with technological undertones
3. **Pulsar** - Astronomical term with a rhythmic, technological sound
4. **Aerodyne** - Vintage aerospace term with a dynamic feel
5. **Zenith** - Suggests the highest point or aspiration
6. **Launchcode** - Merges space launch with programming references
7. **Novascape** - Evokes new frontiers and cosmic landscapes
8. **Stellaris** - References stars and space exploration
9. **Cosmopunk** - Direct reference to the NASA punk aesthetic
10. **Astrovan** - Playful nod to NASA history with a retro feel

**Recommendation:** I recommend "Cosmodrome" as the system name. It has a distinctly retro-futuristic sound, references Soviet space program history (adding to the retro aesthetic), and has a strong, memorable quality that works well for a design system.

## Analysis of Theme Selection

Your initial instincts were sound! The combination works exceptionally well for several reasons:

### Apollo (Dark Theme)

- **Base colors:** Apollo's warm dark base (#1A1D21) provides an excellent foundation that feels like vintage NASA equipment without being too cold or sterile
- **Accent colors:** Voyager's vibrant accent colors create the perfect contrast with Apollo's more subdued base, mimicking the look of illuminated switches and indicators on control panels
- The combination showcases the "worn but functional" quality of NASA equipment combined with futuristic displays

### Horizon (Light Theme)

- **Base colors:** Launchpad's technical, blueprint-inspired light base provides the perfect foundation for a light theme that still feels connected to space program aesthetics
- **Accent colors:** Horizon's rich accent colors bring the optimistic Space Age feel to the technical base, creating a theme that evokes NASA technical documents with a retrofuturistic flavor
- The combination balances technical precision with hopeful futurism

The contrast values have been carefully calibrated to ensure optimal accessibility while maintaining the aesthetic. This condensed approach gives you a focused, cohesive system that remains true to the original vision.

## Prompt

Cosmodrome is the perfect name, thank you! It also invokes nostalgia for a time when the video game series Destiny initially released, and brings me back to the great times that I had playing it.

In terms of feedback for the design system document, I would like to make the following adjustments:

- The tagline under the title should be removed.
- Remove the **Design Philosophy** section.
- The **About Cosmodrome** section should be the introductory text sitting right beneath the title, should not have the **About Cosmodrome** header, and should read: "Cosmodrome is a comprehensive color system designed for applications with a retro-futuristic and space exploration aesthetic. Drawing inspiration from vintage NASA control rooms, technical blueprints, and retro sci-fi interfaces, Cosmodrome provides a balanced approach to color with optimized accessibility and visual harmony. Initially conceived as a spin of [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)."
- Both of the main theme sections should sit right beneath the **Theme Flavors** section.
- Merge **Usage Guidelines** and **Implementation Guide** into a single section (they feel a bit redundant), and position them directly beneath the main theme sections.
  The **Theme Switching** section should be removed.

## Response

I'll make those adjustments right away. The Destiny nostalgia is a nice bonus connection - Cosmodrome definitely has that retro-futuristic space exploration vibe that resonates with players from that era.

I've made all the adjustments you requested to the Cosmodrome design system document:

1. Removed the tagline under the title
2. Removed the Design Philosophy section
3. Moved the About Cosmodrome content to be the introduction text directly under the title, added the Catppuccin reference
4. Placed both theme sections (Apollo and Horizon) right after the Theme Flavors section
5. Merged Usage Guidelines and Implementation Guide into a single section and positioned it after the theme sections
6. Removed the Theme Switching section

The document now has a cleaner, more straightforward structure that focuses on the essential aspects of the design system. The Catppuccin reference acknowledges the inspiration while establishing Cosmodrome as its own distinct system with a retro-futuristic space exploration aesthetic.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or enhance about the document?
