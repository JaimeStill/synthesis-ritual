# Iteration 01 - 2025 05 21

I've been reviewing the Catppuccin specification further, and believe there are some enhancements to be made to the Cosmodrome design system. Cosmodrome should adhere as close as possible to structure of Catppuccin, just varying in two key ways:

- Align with the aesthetic that differentiates Cosmodrome from Catppuccin.
- Cosmodrome currently only focuses on two flavors: light and dark. Catppuccin provides 4 flavors: 2 dark variants, and 2 light variants.
  - This differentiation can be addressed at a later point if there is ever determined to be a need, but that is not currently the case.

## Resources

To provide a point of reference to the enhancements that will be described in the instructions below, I'm giving links to key documents that describe the structure of Catppuccin in a way that will allow the underlying color system structure to be standardized. This will allow aesthetic spins to be easily created and integrated with the platforms Catppuccin supports both natively and through its ports.

> **Example**\
> The **Style Guide** defines a **Typography** section with a **Function** of **Links, URLs** and a **Colors** section indicating **Blue** should be used. It then provides a column showing specific hues of blue used by Catppuccin.
>
> The column representing the specific hues used by Catppuccin should be discarded. The rest of the information provides structure to the style guide, but the specific colors should be derived from the design system of the aesthetic being developed (in this case, Cosmodrome).

- [Specs](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/blob/main/docs/specs.md) - Defines clear specifications for how Catppuccin defines **Palette**, **Sub-palettes**, and **Infrastructure** (Crust, Mantle, and Base hierarchy).
  - In the case of **Palette**, Cosmodrome will differ in only consisting of two flavors: **Apollo** and **Horizon**.
- [Style Guide](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/blob/main/docs/style-guide.md) - This provides an excellent guide for how colors are used in specific areas of design.
- [`palette.json`](https://github.com/catppuccin/palette/blob/main/palette.json) - provides a reference to the color values specified in the tables of **Style Guide**.
  - use this purely as a reference to how the values are structured so that aesthetically accurate values can be derived for Cosmodrome.

## Avatar

You are an expert designer with a deep understanding of color theory, UI / UX design principles, and accessibility considerations. You also have a deep knowledge and appreciation for the retro futurism and NASA punk aesthetics, and wish to see Cosmodrome evolve into a fully realized spin of Catppuccin while simultaneously deriving an aesthetically agnostic standardized design structure from what Catppuccin is built on.

## Instructions

Using the provided resources, in conjunction with `cosmodrome-design-system.md`, generate a style guide for Cosomodrome. Use the structure of the Catppuccin resources as inspiration for the layout, but derive the actual color values from the Cosmodrome design system.
