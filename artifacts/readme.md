# Artifacts

`artifacts` contains more developed iterations of [`concepts`](../concepts) that have progressed beyond the initial concept stage. They have materialized into more structured and comprehensive forms, but are not yet finalized implementations.

## Structure

Standalone artifacts are stored as single documents in the root of the repository. If an artifact is comprised of more than one document, it is represented as a sub-directory.

## Characteristics of Artifacts

Artifacts:
- Synthesize multiple concepts into a more coherent whole.
- Should have realistic boundaries and scope.
- Should link to the concepts that were established to develop the artifact.

When an artifact reaches a state of completion where it represents a finalized work, it will be distributed into the [`codex`](../codex/).
