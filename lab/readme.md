# Lab

The `lab` hosts a collection of `experiments` for exploring code-based concepts and practical implementations. Experiments serve as a workspace for testing, prototyping and simulating ideas. It provides a controlled environment to validate concepts and develop artifacts through practical application.

## Structure

Each experiment should be contained within its own subdirectory and include:

- Source code
- Documentation explaining the purpose and methodology
- Instructions for running/replicating the experiment
- Results and observations
- References to related concepts and artifacts

## Experiment Guidelines

- Keep experiments focused on testing specific hypotheses
- Document dependencies and environment setup clearly
- Maintain separation between experiments to prevent interference
- Include analysis of results and implications for the broader topic of study

Successful experiments may contribute to `artifacts` or evolve directly into the `codex`.
