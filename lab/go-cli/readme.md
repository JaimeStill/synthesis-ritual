As a professional C# developer, I would like help initializing a Go project intended as a starting point for building a CLI tool. Please use the latest, most native features possible.

# Response

As a C# developer venturing into Go for CLI development, you'll find some similarities in structured programming while enjoying Go's simplicity. Let me help you set up a modern Go CLI project using the latest features.

I'll create an [artifact](./cli-starter.md) with a complete starter project structure that follows Go best practices.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Initialize your Go module

```bash
# Create your project directory
mkdir my-cli
cd my-cli

# Initialize a Go module (replace with your GitHub username)
go mod init github.com/yourusername/my-cli

# Install dependencies
go get github.com/spf13/cobra
go get github.com/spf13/viper
```

#### 2. Key Features of this Project Structure

- **Modern Go Module System**: Uses Go modules for dependency management
- **Cobra & Viper**: Industry-standard libraries for building CLI apps (similar to System.CommandLine in .NET)
- **Clean Architecture**:
  - `cmd/`: Contains command definitions
  - `internal/`: Private application code
  - `pkg/`: Potentially reusable code
  - `main.go`: Minimal entry point

#### 3. Notable Go Features Used

- **Error Handling**: Idiomatic Go error propagation
- **Package Organization**: Following standard Go project layout
- **Flag Parsing**: Using Cobra's flag system (similar to argument parsing in C#)
- **Configuration Management**: Using Viper for config files and environment variables

#### 4. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the binary
go build -o my-cli

# Run the application
./my-cli
./my-cli example
./my-cli example --verbose
```

#### 5. Next Steps

To extend this CLI, you can:

- Add more subcommands in the `cmd` package
- Implement business logic in the `internal` package
- Define shared utilities in the `pkg` package

Let me know if you'd like to focus on any specific aspect of Go CLI development, or if you want to adapt this for a particular use case!

# Prompt

Please create an artifact that serves as a cheat sheet for the concepts Iâ€™ll need to know in Go as a C# developer. Particularly:

- core data structures
- patterns for constructing object hierarchies
- parallel / asynchronous programming and go routines

# Response

I've created a comprehensive [Go cheat sheet](./cheat-sheet.md) tailored specifically for you as a C# developer. The cheat sheet covers all the requested areas with direct comparisons to C# concepts you're already familiar with.

A few highlights from the cheat sheet:

**Core Data Structures**

- Go slices (`[]Type`) are similar to C#'s `List<T>` but with some important differences
- Maps (`map[KeyType]ValueType`) replace C# dictionaries
- Structs in Go serve as the foundation for "classes"

**Object Hierarchies**

- Go uses composition rather than inheritance
- The factory function pattern replaces constructors
- Method receivers (both value and pointer) provide behavior
- Interfaces are implicitly implemented

**Concurrency**

- Goroutines are lightweight compared to Tasks/TPL
- Channels provide the primary communication mechanism
- The `sync` package offers mutex, wait groups, and more
- Context for cancellation patterns

What's particularly interesting for you as a C# developer is that Go approaches many problems with a different philosophy. While C# has been adding more functional features over time, Go has maintained its simplicity with a focus on composition and explicit behavior.

Is there any specific aspect of the cheat sheet you'd like me to elaborate on further?

# Prompt

Can you modify the artifact to include a section describing how to think around using pointers and references vs passing by value?

# Response

I'll add a section on pointers, references, and value semantics to help clarify these concepts for C# developers.

I've updated the cheat sheet with a comprehensive section on pointers and value semantics in Go, specifically tailored for C# developers. The new section covers:

1. **C# vs Go Memory Model** - A direct comparison between C# reference/value types and Go's pointer/value types

2. **Pointers in Go** - Basic syntax and operations with practical examples

3. **When to Use Pointers vs Values** - Clear guidelines for both approaches:
   - Use pointers for modifying values, large structs, optional values, and interface implementations
   - Use values for small types, immutability, and types that are already reference-like

4. **Go vs C# Mental Model** - How to adjust your thinking when switching between languages

5. **Common Gotchas for C# Developers** - Including slice append behavior, method receivers, nil handling, and interface values

6. **Performance Considerations** - Stack vs heap allocation, cache-friendly code, method call performance

7. **Best Practices** - Consistency, API design, optimization advice, and garbage collection considerations

This should help you build a mental model of how memory and references work in Go compared to your C# experience, which is crucial for writing efficient and correct Go code.

Is there anything specific about pointers or value semantics you'd like me to expand on further?

# Prompt

Please optimize the order of the section in the cheat sheet and it will be perfect. Thank you!

# Response

I'll optimize the order of sections in the cheat sheet to create a more logical progression from basic to advanced concepts.

I've reorganized the cheat sheet with an optimized section order that creates a better learning progression:

1. **Core Data Structures** - First understanding Go's fundamental types and how they map to C# equivalents
2. **Pointers and Value Semantics** - Moved up as this is crucial to understand before tackling higher-level patterns
3. **Object-Oriented Patterns in Go** - Building on the foundation of structs and pointers
4. **Concurrency and Parallelism** - Advanced topics after basics are covered
5. **Common C# to Go Translations** - Quick reference section for mapping between languages
6. **Key Differences to Remember** - Summary to reinforce the main distinctions

This ordering creates a more natural flow from basic concepts to advanced ones and should make the transition from C# to Go more intuitive. The pointers section now appears earlier in the document, which helps establish that mental model before diving into object patterns and concurrency.

The cheat sheet should now be ready for you to use as a reference during your Go development journey!

# Prompt

Can you generate an artifact that serves as a quick reference to the go std library?

# Response

I've created a comprehensive [quick reference guide](./std-lib-ref.md) to the Go standard library. This artifact is designed to help you find the most commonly used packages and functions quickly as you transition from C# to Go.

The reference covers:

1. **Core Packages** - Essential packages like `fmt`, `strings`, and `errors`
2. **I/O and Files** - File operations with `os`, `io`, `bufio`, and `filepath`
3. **Data Structures** - Working with collections via `sort`, `container/list`, and `container/heap`
4. **Concurrency** - Go's powerful concurrency tools like `sync`, `atomic`, and `context`
5. **Networking** - HTTP client/server with `net/http` and `net/url`
6. **Encoding/Decoding** - Support for JSON, XML, CSV, and more
7. **Time and Date** - Working with time via the `time` package
8. **Testing** - Writing tests with the `testing` package
9. **CLI and Environment** - Command-line flags and logging
10. **Utility Packages** - Math functions, random numbers, regular expressions

Each section includes code snippets showing the most common usage patterns, which should make it easier to find equivalents to the C# functionality you're used to.

The reference concludes with some key tips for transitioning from C# to Go, emphasizing important differences in the programming models.

Is there any specific area of the standard library you'd like me to expand on further?

# Prompt

Does the CLI project support autocompletion in the terminal? If not, how is this accomplished?

# Response

The CLI project I shared initially doesn't have autocompletion enabled, but the Cobra library we're using makes it easy to add this functionality. Let me explain how to implement it:

## Adding Autocompletion to Your Go CLI

Cobra (the library we used in the initial project) has built-in support for generating shell completion scripts. Here's how to enable it:

### 1. Add a Completion Command

First, add a new command to generate completion scripts:

```go
// In cmd/completion.go
package cmd

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func newCompletionCmd() *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]",
		Short: "Generate completion script",
		Long: `To load completions:

Bash:
  $ source <(my-cli completion bash)

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  # Linux:
  $ my-cli completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/my-cli
  # macOS:
  $ my-cli completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/my-cli

Zsh:
  # If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
  # you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

  $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ my-cli completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_my-cli"

  # You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Fish:
  $ my-cli completion fish | source

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ my-cli completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/my-cli.fish

PowerShell:
  PS> my-cli completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

  # To load completions for every new session, run:
  PS> my-cli completion powershell > my-cli.ps1
  # and source this file from your PowerShell profile.
`,
		DisableFlagsInUseLine: true,
		ValidArgs:             []string{"bash", "zsh", "fish", "powershell"},
		Args:                  cobra.ExactValidArgs(1),
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			switch args[0] {
			case "bash":
				cmd.Root().GenBashCompletion(os.Stdout)
			case "zsh":
				cmd.Root().GenZshCompletion(os.Stdout)
			case "fish":
				cmd.Root().GenFishCompletion(os.Stdout, true)
			case "powershell":
				cmd.Root().GenPowerShellCompletionWithDesc(os.Stdout)
			}
		},
	}

	return cmd
}
```

### 2. Register the Completion Command

Add the command to your root command in `cmd/root.go`:

```go
func init() {
    // Other initialization...
    rootCmd.AddCommand(newCompletionCmd())
}
```

### 3. Enable Argument Completions

For custom argument completions (like suggesting file names or custom values), you can add ValidArgsFunction to your commands:

```go
cmd := &cobra.Command{
    // ...
    ValidArgsFunction: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string, toComplete string) ([]string, cobra.ShellCompDirective) {
        // Return suggestions like:
        return []string{"suggestion1", "suggestion2"}, cobra.ShellCompDirectiveNoFileComp
    },
}
```

### 4. Flag Completion

For flag values, you can add completion to specific flags:

```go
cmd.Flags().String("format", "", "Output format")
cmd.RegisterFlagCompletionFunc("format", func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string, toComplete string) ([]string, cobra.ShellCompDirective) {
    return []string{"json", "yaml", "text"}, cobra.ShellCompDirectiveNoFileComp
})
```

## Advanced Completion Features

For more sophisticated autocompletion scenarios:

1. **Dynamic Values**: You can fetch completion values from a datasource
2. **File Type Filtering**: Suggest only certain file types
3. **Context-Aware Completion**: Change suggestions based on previous arguments

## Usage by Users

After implementing completion, users need to:

1. Generate the completion script for their shell
2. Source it in their shell profile

For example, with Bash:

```bash
# Generate and use immediately
source <(your-cli completion bash)

# Or save for future sessions
your-cli completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/your-cli
```

Would you like me to demonstrate any specific aspect of CLI autocompletion in more detail?
