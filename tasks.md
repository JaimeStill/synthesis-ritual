# Tasks

- [ ] Have Claude integrate concepts from [`consciousness-tether`](./concepts/consciousness-tether/) into the evolutionary structure of the [`quantum-synthesis`](./concepts/quantum-synthesis/) developmental narrative.
    - Establish scientific discoveries
    - Derive technological innovations from these discoveries
    - Determine the impacts these advancements have on the overall narrative; begin to think through how you and the world around you may be affected.
- [ ] Rename the term `artifact` to `cipher` in the context of synthesis ritual, as it is overloaded with the concept of self-contained artifacts generated by the LLM. See this [Claude prompt](https://claude.ai/chat/7b68a6c9-b4ba-4ab7-8c31-f1b37e637567).
    - This should help you feel more comfortable using the term `artifact` for its intended meaning.
    - Also take this moment to validate details in guidelines and subdirectory readmes.
- [ ] Start fleshing out more hard-science / technology focused developments within the timeline. Use this as an opportunity to evaluate terms specified in the glossary.
- [ ] Start generating an appendix of technologies and scientific discoveries.
- [ ] Begin the process of fleshing out characters, settings, organizations; all of the aspects that bring live to the narrative.
